# Knowledge Distillation for Image Classification
Teacher-Student Mechanism to compress model & improve compact models
 

## Loss functions & Details
Standard Cross-entropy Loss between true targets y<sub>k</sub> and the network's outputs p<sub>k</sub><br>
![standard cross entropy loss](images/cross_entropy_loss.png)

### 1. Knowledge Distillation <sup>[1]</sup>
###### Use soft label produced by teacher model to direct student model.<br>

Softmax output layer converts the logit *z<sub>i</sub>* computed for each class into a probability, *q<sub>i</sub>*,
by comparing *z<sub>i</sub>* with the other logits.<br>
![softmax_output](images/Softmax_output.png) <br>
```
where
* T: temperature, the higher temperature is, the softer probability distribution is;
* z: network's output logits; 
```
Notes: 
* If teacher model is the result of an ensemble, either *z* or *q* are obtained by averaging outputs of models.

* If correct labels are known for all or some of the transfer set, use a weighted average of two different 
objective functions.
  1. cross entropy loss with the soft targets 
  2. cross entropy loss with the correct labels
  3. Empirically,
  * Best results obtained by using a lower weight of second loss; 
  * It's important to multiply 1<sup>st</sup> loss by T<sup>2</sup> when using both the two losses.

### 2. FitNets<sup>[2]</sup>
###### Compress *wide & shallow* networks into *narrow & deep* networks
###### Introduce *intermediate-level* hints to guide student

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Hint         |Output of teacher's hidden layer; responsible for guiding student      |
|Hint Layer   |The hidden layer in teacher model                                      |
|Guided Layer |The chosen hidden layer in student model                               |
|Regressor    |Add to guided layer, outputs matches the size of hint layer            |
* The deeper the guided layer is , the less flexibility the network has, the more possibly the model get over-regularization. 
#### 2.2 Stage-wise Training
1. Stage I: Pre-train student network up to guided layer, based on the prediction error of the teacher's hint layer

## Results
#### CIFAR
Top1 error rate on the CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks are reported. You may get different results when training your models with different random seed.
Note that the number of parameters are computed on the CIFAR-10 dataset.<br>
```Top-1 Accuracy is the best one, while Top-5 is one at the last epoch.```
