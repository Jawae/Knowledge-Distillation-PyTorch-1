# Knowledge Distillation
Teacher-Student Mechanism to compress model & improve compact models
 

## Loss functions & Details
Standard Cross-entropy Loss between true targets y<sub>k</sub> and the network's outputs p<sub>k</sub><br>

#### 1. Knowledge Distillation <sup>[1]</sup>
Use soft label produced by teacher model to direct student model.<br>
Softmax output layer converts the logit z<sub>i</sub> computed for each class into a probability, q<sub>i</sub>,
by comparing z<sub>i</sub> with the other logits.<br>

* T: temperature, the higher temperature is, the softer probability distribution is;<br>
* z: logits<br>

If correct labels are known for all or sim of the transfer set, use a weighted average of two different 
objective functions.
```
1. cross entropy loss with the soft targets 
2. cross entropy loss with the correct labels
```
* Best results obtained by using a lower weight of second loss; 
* It's important to multiply 1<sup>st</sup> loss by T<sup>2</sup> when using both the two losses.

## Results
#### CIFAR
Top1 error rate on the CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks are reported. You may get different results when training your models with different random seed.
Note that the number of parameters are computed on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\
```Top-1 Accuracy is the best one, while Top-5 is one at the last epoch.```
